# Thesis-Code

This repository contains the scripts and data used for my Master’s thesis analysis.

## Folder structure

- **`code/`**  
  All R scripts that perform data import, cleaning, transformation, and the regression analyses and visualizations.

- **`data/`**  
  Raw and processed datasets (CSV, Excel) that the scripts in `code/` read from and write to.


That’s it!
